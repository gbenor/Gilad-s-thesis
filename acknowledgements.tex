\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my supervisor, \textbf{Dr. Isana Veksler-Lublinsky}, for providing guidance and feedback throughout this project. As both a teacher and a mentor, she had taught me far more than I could ever express in words. She has shown me through numerous examples, what it means to be a good scientist and a good person.
