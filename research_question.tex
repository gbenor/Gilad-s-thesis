\chapter{Research Questions}
\label{chap:rq}

The ultimate goal of this work was to study the transferability of miRNA-target interaction rules between organisms. For addressing this goal, we have formulated the following questions, which have been addressed in the course of this thesis work:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the available datasets of chimeric miRNA-target interactions from a variety of organisms?
\item What are the specifications of a standard format, to represent all the available datasets?
\item What are the high-level and raw-level features that best represent interactions?
\item What are the key features of miRNA-target interactions for each organism?
\item What is the performance of machine learning models in predicting organism interactions different from the one they have trained on?
\item What are the different factors that best explain the observed results, and do they coincide with the evolutionary distance?
\end{enumerate}

The work is expected to provide important insights on the key features of miRNA-target interactions, the transferability of miRNA-targeting rules between different organisms, and whether this transferability depends on the evolutionary distance.
